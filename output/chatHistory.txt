hanks. Interesting! I see that there was a big army expense increase around 2007 in Georgia. What happened? any war?
AI Message:
In 2008, Georgia experienced a significant military expenditure increase due to the Russo-Georgian War. This conflict, also known as the Russian invasion of Georgia, involved the Russian Federation and the Russian-backed separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is considered the first European war of the 21st century.

The war began on August 1, 2008, when South Ossetian forces, supported by Russia, started shelling Georgian villages. In response, Georgia sent troops into the South Ossetian conflict zone on August 7. Russia then launched a full-scale invasion of Georgia on August 8, claiming it was a "peace enforcement" operation.

The conflict resulted in significant destruction and displacement, with Russian forces temporarily occupying several Georgian cities. The war ended with a ceasefire agreement on August 12, 2008, but tensions and geopolitical impacts continued.
