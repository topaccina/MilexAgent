Thanks. Interesting! I see that there was a big army expense increase around 2007 in Georgia. What happened? any war?
AI Message:
In 2008, Georgia experienced a significant increase in military expenditures due to the Russo-Georgian War, also known as the Russian invasion of Georgia. This conflict involved the Russian Federation and the Russian-backed separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. It is considered the first European war of the 21st century.

The conflict began on August 1, 2008, when South Ossetian forces, backed by Russia, started shelling Georgian villages. In response, Georgia sent army units into the South Ossetian conflict zone on August 7. Russia then launched a full-scale invasion of Georgia on August 8, claiming it was a "peace enforcement" operation.

The war resulted in significant destruction and displacement, with Russian forces temporarily occupying several Georgian cities. The conflict ended with a ceasefire agreement on August 12, 2008, but tensions and unresolved issues remain.
